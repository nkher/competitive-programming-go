Further Explanation:

How does this work?
Let there be total N nodes in list. It is easier to understand from last node.

The probability that last node is result simply 1/N [For last or Nâ€™th node, we generate a random number between 0 to N-1 and make last node as result if the generated number is 0 (or any other fixed number]

The probability that second last node is result should also be 1/N.

The probability that the second last node is result 
          = [Probability that the second last node replaces result] X 
            [Probability that the last node doesn't replace the result] 
          = [1 / (N-1)] * [(N-1)/N]
          = 1/N
